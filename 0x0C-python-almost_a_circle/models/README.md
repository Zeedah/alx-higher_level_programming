Write the class Square that inherits from Rectangle:



In the file models/square.py

Class Square inherits from Rectangle

Class constructor: def __init__(self, size, x=0, y=0, id=None)::

Call the super class with id, x, y, width and height - this super call will use the logic of the __init__ of the Rectangle class. The width and height must be assigned to the value of size

You must not create new attributes for this class, use all attributes of Rectangle - As reminder: a Square is a Rectangle with the same width and height
